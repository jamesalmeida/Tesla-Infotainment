# Tesla Infotainment Simulator

Experience a simulated Tesla infotainment system in your browser!

[Live Demo](https://jamesalmeida.github.io/tesla-infotainment/)

## Features to try out

- Realistic 3D model of Tesla Model Y. Try opening the trunk and frunk!
- Interactive infotainment system simulation. Play a podcast, adjust the volume, etc.
- Put the car in reverse and see what's behind you!
- Try navigating on the map and turning on traffic.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes. Works best on desktop but try it out on your phone in landscape mode too.

## Build for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`
To make this project work as a Github Page, I added this command to deploy to a Github Page. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
